# Tensorflow_Project

Hello ! This is an object detection project based on Tensorflow. Other IDEs, dependencies and libraries which are used during the making of this project are Anaconda, Jupyter
Notebook, Cuda toolkit and CuDnn, Tensorflow Object Detection API, Protobuf and COCO API. The above mentioned dependencies and libraries are being advised to setup beforehand
to properly run this project.The ".ipynb" and ".mp4" both must be in the "tensorflow\models\research\object_detection" for the python file to effectively detect the video. 
I have also attached some video samples :). Hope you like it!!
